### CPSC 120

* Lab 10 [https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652784]

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to write code where I could see real world functionality. Code that calculates demographics is the type of code that something like the US census. It was difficult to grab the population as a string and then convert it into an integer but after figuring it out the lab was enjoyable.

* Lab 7 [https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652801]

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite as well. I've played the game many times with my buddies so it was kinda cool to incorperate it into my coding. I was able to write functions which was really confusing at first but I see how they will be useful in the future. I was able to use functions to calculate the hands value.

* Lab 6 [https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3445940/assignments/35652799]

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite of mine since I was able to learn how to incorporate command line words. I was learned to write code which incorperated command line strings into a sentence. I liked that I was able to input information through the command line and not just the cin.
